Here are locations on the system that could lead to the **execution** of a binary **without** **user** **interaction**.

### Launchd

**`launchd`** is the **first** **process** executed by OX S kernel at startup and the last one to finish at shut down. It should always have the **PID 1**. This process will **read and execute** the configurations indicated in the **ASEP** **plists** in:

* `/Library/LaunchAgents`: Per-user agents installed by the admin
* `/Library/LaunchDaemons`: System-wide daemons installed by the admin
* `/System/Library/LaunchAgents`: Per-user agents provided by Apple.
* `/System/Library/LaunchDaemons`: System-wide daemons provided by Apple.

When a user logs in the plists located in `/Users/$USER/Library/LaunchAgents` and `/Users/$USER/Library/LaunchDemons` are started with the **logged users permissions**.

The **main difference between agents and daemons is that agents are loaded when the user logs in and the daemons are loaded at system startup** (as there are services like ssh that needs to be executed before any user access the system). Also agents may use GUI while daemons need to run in the background.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
    <key>Label</key>
        <string>com.apple.someidentifier</string>
    <key>ProgramArguments</key>
    <array>
        <string>/Users/username/malware</string>
    </array>
    <key>RunAtLoad</key><true/> <!--Execute at system startup-->
    <key>StartInterval</key>
    <integer>800</integer> <!--Execute each 800s-->
    <key>KeepAlive</key>
    <dict>
        <key>SuccessfulExit</key></false> <!--Re-execute if exit unsuccessful-->
        <!--If previous is true, then re-execute in successful exit-->
    </dict>
</dict>
</plist>
```

There are cases where an **agent needs to be executed before the user logins**, these are called **PreLoginAgents**. For example, this is useful to provide assistive technology at login. They can be found also in `/Library/LaunchAgents`(see [**here**](https://github.com/HelmutJ/CocoaSampleCode/tree/master/PreLoginAgents) an example).

\{% hint style="info" %\} New Daemons or Agents config files will be **loaded after next reboot or using** `launchctl load <target.plist>` It's **also possible to load .plist files without that extension** with `launchctl -F <file>` (however those plist files won't be automatically loaded after reboot).\
It's also possible to **unload** with `launchctl unload <target.plist>` (the process pointed by it will be terminated),

To **ensure** that there isn't **anything** (like an override) **preventing** an **Agent** or **Daemon** **from** **running** run: `sudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemos/com.apple.smdb.plist` \{% endhint %\}

List all the agents and daemons loaded by the current user:

```bash
launchctl list
```

### Cron

List the cron jobs of the **current user** with:

```bash
crontab -l
```

You can also see all the cron jobs of the users in **`/usr/lib/cron/tabs/`** and **`/var/at/tabs/`** (needs root).

In MacOS several folders executing scripts with **certain frequency** can be found in:

```bash
ls -lR /usr/lib/cron/tabs/ /private/var/at/jobs /etc/periodic/
```

There you can find the regular **cron** **jobs**, the **at** **jobs** (not very used) and the **periodic** **jobs** (mainly used for cleaning temporary files). The daily periodic jobs can be executed for example with: `periodic daily`.

The periodic scripts (**`/etc/periodic`**) are executed because of the **launch daemons** configured in `/System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.periodic*`. Note that if a script is stored in `/etc/periodic/` as a way to **escalate privilege**s, it will be **executed** as the **owner of the file**.

```bash
ls -l /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.periodic*
-rw-r--r--  1 root  wheel  887 May 13 00:29 /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.periodic-daily.plist
-rw-r--r--  1 root  wheel  895 May 13 00:29 /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.periodic-monthly.plist
-rw-r--r--  1 root  wheel  891 May 13 00:29 /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.periodic-weekly.plist
```

### kext

In order to install a KEXT as a startup item, it needs to be **installed in one of the following locations**:

* `/System/Library/Extensions`
  * KEXT files built into the OS X operating system.
* `/Library/Extensions`
  * KEXT files installed by 3rd party software

You can list currently loaded kext files with:

```bash
kextstat #List loaded kext
kextload /path/to/kext.kext #Load a new one based on path
kextload -b com.apple.driver.ExampleBundle #Load a new one based on path
kextunload /path/to/kext.kext
kextunload -b com.apple.driver.ExampleBundle
```

For more information about [**kernel extensions check this section**](macos-security-and-privilege-escalation/mac-os-architecture#i-o-kit-drivers).

### **Login Items**

In System Preferences -> Users & Groups -> **Login Items** you can find **items to be executed when the user logs in**.\
It it's possible to list them, add and remove from the command line:

```bash
#List all items:
osascript -e 'tell application "System Events" to get the name of every login item'

#Add an item:
osascript -e 'tell application "System Events" to make login item at end with properties {path:"/path/to/itemname", hidden:false}' 

#Remove an item:
osascript -e 'tell application "System Events" to delete login item "itemname"' 
```

These items are stored in the file /Users/\<username>/Library/Application Support/com.apple.backgroundtaskmanagementagent

### At

‚ÄúAt tasks‚Äù are used to **schedule tasks at specific times**.\
These tasks differ from cron in that **they are one time tasks** t**hat get removed after executing**. However, they will **survive a system restart** so they can‚Äôt be ruled out as a potential threat.

By **default** they are **disabled** but the **root** user can **enable** **them** with:

```bash
sudo launchctl load -F /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.atrun.plist
```

This will create a file at 13:37:

```bash
echo hello > /tmp/hello | at 1337
```

If AT tasks aren't enabled the created tasks won't be executed.

### Login/Logout Hooks

They are deprecated but can be used to execute commands when a user logs in.

```bash
cat > $HOME/hook.sh << EOF
#!/bin/bash
echo 'My is: \`id\`' > /tmp/login_id.txt
EOF
chmod +x $HOME/hook.sh
defaults write com.apple.loginwindow LoginHook /Users/$USER/hook.sh
```

This setting is stored in `/Users/$USER/Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow.plist`

```bash
defaults read /Users/$USER/Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow.plist
{
    LoginHook = "/Users/username/hook.sh";
    MiniBuddyLaunch = 0;
    TALLogoutReason = "Shut Down";
    TALLogoutSavesState = 0;
    oneTimeSSMigrationComplete = 1;
}
```

To delete it:

```bash
defaults delete com.apple.loginwindow LoginHook
```

In the previous example we have created and deleted a **LoginHook**, it's also possible to create a **LogoutHook**.

The root user one is stored in `/private/var/root/Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow.plist`

### Emond

Apple introduced a logging mechanism called **emond**. It appears it was never fully developed, and development may have been **abandoned** by Apple for other mechanisms, but it remains **available**.

This little-known service may **not be much use to a Mac admin**, but to a threat actor one very good reason would be to use it as a **persistence mechanism that most macOS admins probably wouldn't know** to look for. Detecting malicious use of emond shouldn't be difficult, as the System LaunchDaemon for the service looks for scripts to run in only one place:

```bash
ls -l /private/var/db/emondClients
```

{% hint style="danger" %}
**As this isn't used much, anything in that folder should be suspicious**
{% endhint %}

### Startup Items

\{% hint style="danger" %\} **This is deprecated, so nothing should be found in the following directories.** \{% endhint %\}

A **StartupItem** is a **directory** that gets **placed** in one of these two folders. `/Library/StartupItems/` or `/System/Library/StartupItems/`

After placing a new directory in one of these two locations, **two more items** need to be placed inside that directory. These two items are a **rc script** **and a plist** that holds a few settings. This plist must be called ‚Äú**StartupParameters.plist**‚Äù.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="StartupParameters.plist" %}
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple Computer//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
    <key>Description</key>
        <string>This is a description of this service</string>
    <key>OrderPreference</key>
        <string>None</string> <!--Other req services to execute before this -->
    <key>Provides</key>
    <array>
        <string>superservicename</string> <!--Name of the services provided by this file -->
    </array>
</dict>
</plist>
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="superservicename" %}
```bash
#!/bin/sh
. /etc/rc.common

StartService(){
    touch /tmp/superservicestarted
}

StopService(){
    rm /tmp/superservicestarted
}

RestartService(){
    echo "Restarting"
}

RunService "$1"
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### /etc/rc.common

{% hint style="danger" %}
**This isn't working in modern MacOS versions**
{% endhint %}

It's also possible to place here **commands that will be executed at startup.** Example os regular rc.common script:

```bash
#
# Common setup for startup scripts.

	test=$(ifconfig -a inet 2>/dev/null | sed -n -e '/127.0.0.1/d' -e '/0.0.0.0/d' -e '/inet/p' | wc -l)
	if [ "${test}" -gt 0 ]; then
	    NETWORKUP="-YES-"
	else
	    NETWORKUP="-NO-"
	fi
    fi
}

alias ConsoleMessage=echo

#
# Process management
#
GetPID ()
{
    local program="$1"
    local pidfile="${PIDFILE:=/var/run/${program}.pid}"
    local     pid=""

    if [ -f "${pidfile}" ]; then
	pid=$(head -1 "${pidfile}")
	if ! kill -0 "${pid}" 2> /dev/null; then
	    echo "Bad pid file $pidfile; deleting."
	    pid=""
	    rm -f "${pidfile}"
	fi
    fi

    if [ -n "${pid}" ]; then
	echo "${pid}"
	return 0
    else
	return 1
    fi
}

#
# Generic action handler
#
RunService ()
{
    case $1 in
      start  ) StartService   ;;
      stop   ) StopService    ;;
      restart) RestartService ;;
      *      ) echo "$0: unknown argument: $1";;
    esac
}
```

### Profiles

Configuration profiles can force a user to use certain browser settings, DNS proxy settings, or VPN settings. Many other payloads are possible which make them ripe for abuse.

You can enumerate them running:

```bash
ls -Rl /Library/Managed\ Preferences/
```
